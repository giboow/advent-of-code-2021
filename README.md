# Advent of code 2021

This project is gather all my answers for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

# JS 
To install the project make sure you have nodejs installed and run the following command:
```npm install``` or ```yarn```

I propose to deal first with response scripts in JS, then you can find the code in the JS directory.
You can launch each challenge with the command ``node day{x}.js`` or ``yarn day{x}.js``


#Rust
I'm not sure if I can do it, but I can try to resolve puzzle with Rust!
Go to the Rust directory and run the following command: ```cd day{x} && cargo run```
``````
